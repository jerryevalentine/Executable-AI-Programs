I‚Äôve been experimenting with a different way of practicing **prompt engineering**.  
Instead of treating prompts as static examples, I‚Äôve started writing them as **executable programs**.  

Each program runs like a training exercise: it starts automatically, enforces strict execution rules, and evaluates your work.
